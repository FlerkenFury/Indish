# Indish

Indish is a mobile application designed for everyone that is willing to cook in their home, whether they want to cook for their family, for their friends, or even for themselves. With Indish, you can save your time from wondering what to eat, and buying ingredients again to cook for those dishes, which is quite difficult in this quarantine situation. Instead, it is far more convenient to cook what you can, based on the ingredients that you currently have.

By using Indish, you can search the ingredients that you currently have, and Indish will provide you with tons of recipes that you can cook based on your ingredients. From all of the possible menus, you can choose what would you like to make, and the app will show you the recipe for that menu, such as: the ingredients, the procedures, the description, and the image of the menu. Besides that, you can explore all the ingredients made by other people or add your own recipes that will be shared with other users across the Indish platform. In the future version, Indish is expected to be capable of receiving the Ingredients input from camera sensor.

The developer team of Indish consists of:
- Luis Indracahya (Project Manager)
- Stephen Leonardo (Lead Programmer)
- Leo Christopher Coo (System Analyst)

Indish is developed using android studio as the IDE (Integrated Development Environment), with Java as the programming language and Firebase cloud database as the database. Please note that Indish is currently available only on Android OS. The minimum android version requirement that supports Indish is Android 4.1 Jellybean (or sdk version 16), so Indish can only be used on the phone with android version 4.1 and above. To check your android version, please open your phone and go to settings -> about phone, and check your android version.
